# Maximum flow
# Interpret a directed graph as a "flow network" and use it to answer questions about material flows.
# From source to sink (vector-calculus: the extent to which the vector field flux behaves like a source)

# 2 methods for solving maximum-flow: 
#   1. Ford and Fulkerson - application findintg maximum matching in an undirected bipartite graph
#   2. Push label method
#   2.1 Relabel-to-front imlementation of push label method O(V^3)
# Fromalize flow network, and flows

# Flow-networks G = (V,E) directed graph - each edge (u, v) : E has nonegative capacity c(u,v) >=0
# If (u, v) /: E , then c(u, v) =0
# 2 sources in network - source, and sink. Every vertex lies on the path from source to sink
# So the graph is connected, |E| >= |V|-1
# A flow in G is function F: V x V -> R such that:
# 1. Capacity constraint:  u, v : V, f(u,v) <= c(u,v)
# 2. Skew symmetry:  u, v: V then f(u,v)=-f(v,u)
# 3. Flow constraint: u : V - {s,t} then sum_v:V ( f(u,v)=0 )  - there are no other source/sink 
# Lemma: 
# 1. X \subset V => f(X, X) = 0
# 2. X, Y \subset V => f(X,Y) = -f(Y, X)
# 3. X, Y, Z \subset V and X \intesect Y = Ã˜ => sum(X \union Y, Z ) = f(X,Z)+f(Y,Z) and f(Z,X\union Y)=f(Z,X)+f(Z,Y)

# Fold and Fulkerson: 1. Residual networks, augmenting paths, and cuts.
